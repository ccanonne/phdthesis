\noindent Most of the contents of this dissertation have appeared somewhere in some form.

\cref{chap:unified:ub} is based on two papers: the first, ``Testing Shape Restrictions of Discrete Distributions,'' is joint work with Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, and Ronitt Rubinfeld, and appeared in the Proceedings of the 33\textsuperscript{rd} International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science~\parencite{CDGR:16} as well as in the corresponding special issue of \textit{Theory of Computing Systems}~\parencite{CDGR:17:journal}. The second, ``Fourier-Based Testing for Families of Distributions,'' is joint work with Ilias Diakonikolas and Alistair Stewart, and is currently under submission; a technical report is available at~\parencite{CanonneDS:17}.

\cref{chap:unified:lb} is again based on two papers: the first is~\parencite{CDGR:16}. The second, ``Distribution Testing Lower Bounds \textit{via} Reductions from Communication Complexity,'' is joint work with Eric Blais and Tom Gur, and appeared in the Proceedings of the 32\textsuperscript{nd} Computational Complexity Conference~\parencite{BCG:17}.

\cref{chap:newmodels} once more contains research from two papers. The first, ``Testing probability distributions using conditional samples,'' is joint work with Dana Ron and Rocco Servedio, and appeared in the SIAM Journal on Computing~\parencite{CRS:15}. The second, ``Testing Probability Distributions Underlying Aggregated Data,'' is joint work with Ronitt Rubinfeld, and appeared in the Proceedings of the 41\textsuperscript{st} International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming~\parencite{CR:14}.

Finally,~\cref{chap:correction} is based on the paper ``Sampling Correctors,'' which is joint work with Themis Gouleakis and Ronitt Rubinfeld, and appeared in the Proceedings of the 7\textsuperscript{th} Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science~\parencite{CGR:16}.
